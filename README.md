# STAT545 homework 06
This repo is for STAT545 homework 06.
- [hw06.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-liao02x/blob/master/hw06.html) is for html review.
- [hw06.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-liao02x/blob/master/hw06.Rmd) is the corresponding R markdown source file.

**For this assignment, because `str_view` is a html widget, we should check the .html file and see what it looks like.**

**For your convenience, I forked this repo to my own github account which makes it possible to create a github.io page and do some online html preview. So the link is provided below, and I think it is a good replacement.**
